Ubuntu, originating from the Bantu and Xhosa peoples in South Africa and deeply woven into the social fabric of many African nations, is a model for a universal sense of humanity. Somewhat analogous to Descartes' famous quote "cogito ergo sum", Ubuntu frames our humanity through our connection to others: "I am because we are." This profound sense of human interconnectedness, championed by some of history's most influential leaders such as Desmond Tutu and Nelson Mandela, forms the foundation of my vision. The utility of this type of framework for global health justice has become exceedingly clear with the COVID19 pandemic, as the global vaccine-buying race revealed the flaws of a fragmented global health policy where equitable access to lifesaving vaccines became a voluntary act rather than a universal human right. Though geographically distant, global north and south are neighbours in terms of their shared vulnerability.

In practice this approach acknowledges local and cultural nuances and encourages a bottom-up approach. Recognizing that there is no one-size-fits-all solution, active involvement of local communities in designing and implementing health interventions is crucial. Additionally, part of this acknowledgement lies for me in decolonizing global health bioethics and knowledge production. To date an overwhelming majority of articles are written by authors from high-income countries which undermines efforts to achieve a truly global perspective on bioethics and public health.

Even within well-funded healthcare systems like the one I am lucky enough to live in, disparities in healthcare access and quality persist, disproportionally affecting underserved populations. Globally, these inequities are magnified, with millions lacking adequate healthcare. I envision an inclusive healthcare model that prioritizes prevention & primary care, and leverages digital health solutions.

Welcome to my digital swamp, my own private messy little [[personal knowledge management\|personal knowledge management]] system ><

What initially started as a method to structure the ever-increasing number of medicine notes and summaries became a free-from, work-in progress wiki of my life.

Not all those who wonder are lost: Instead of polished articles displayed in reverse chronological order like a blog, a digital garden is more like a free form, work-in-progress wiki.
